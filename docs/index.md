# Whisper

Whisper is an app that allows someone who doesn’t speak aloud to participate in a spoken conversation with others who do. The *Whisperer* uses the app to type their part of the conversation. The *Listeners* use either the app or a browser to see what the Whisperer is saying. The Listeners speak their responses aloud to the Whisperer and to each other.

To learn how to use the app, visit [Instructions](instructions.md). For help, visit [Support](support.md).

## Privacy

Neither the [Whisper Project](https://whisper-project.org) (the maker of Whisper) nor [Software in the Public Interest](https://spi-inc.org) (the publisher of Whisper) collects, stores, or processes any data about individuals who use Whisper.

The contents of conversations held through Whisper are not stored *anywhere*, even on device-local storage, unless the Whisperer has opted to make transcripts available, in which case the transcripts are stored on the Whisper server for no more than one year and made available only as requested by the Whisperer. These transcripts are not associated with any data about the participants as individuals or any data that can be used to identify the participants as individuals.

The name you enter in the app (or browser, if used for listening) is stored both locally on your device and on the Whisper server. This name is not associated with any data about you as an individual or any data that can be used to identify you as an individual. It is used only to identify you in conversations with other individuals or, after you explicitly give permission, for customer support purposes.

Your favorites and other settings in the Whisper app (called your *user profile*) are stored locally on your device. If you use profile sharing, then your user profile is also stored on the Whisper server. As with the name you enter in the app, your user profile is not associated with any data about you as an individual or any data that can be used to identify you as an individual. It is used on the server only to maintain synchronization between your devices.

Whisper collects and sends to its server a variety of diagnostic data.  This diagnostic data is not associated with any data about you as an individual or any data that can be used to identify you as an individual. This data is never used for any purpose except to resolve issues reported by users and to improve the app's behavior:

* Information about crashes and other errors that interrupt conversations in the Whisper app.
* Identifiers created by the app that are specific to the device, the user’s profile and conversations that the user creates. These identifiers are random strings of characters that are different for each device, user, and conversation.
* The dates and times that the app was launched, that a Whisperer started a conversation, and that a Listener joined a conversation.
* The names of all conversations.

All identifiers created by the app, all names entered by users, all user profiles, and all associated dates/times are purged from the Whisper server if the devices, users, and conversations they are associated with have not been used in the past 12 months.
