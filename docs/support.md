# Support 

If you have a question about using Whisper, please start by reading the [Instructions](instructions.md) page, and then read through the following FAQ. If that does not answer your question(s), or if you just want to provide us with general feedback, there is a support form at the bottom of this page.

## FAQ

### Can more than one person Whisper in the same conversation?

No.  There can only be one Whisperer in each conversation.  There is no limit on the number of Listeners.

### Do I need an iPhone or iPad to use Whisper?

You need an Apple device (iPhone, iPad, or Mac computer) to be the Whisperer, but not to listen. If you don't have an Apple device and want to listen, have the Whisperer send you a link from their app.

To learn how to whisper from the app, see the [instructions page](instructions.md).

To learn how to listen either in the app or in a browser, see the [instructions page](instructions.md).

### If I don't have the app on my device, can I still listen?

Yes, you can still listen using your browser. Just click on the link sent to you by the Whisperer to join the conversation. You will be shown the name of the Whisperer and the name of the conversation, and then asked for your name and to confirm that you want to join the conversation.

### Why do I have to enter my name?

Both Listeners and Whisperers enter their names to make it clear who's in the conversation. Both the app and browsers will remember your name once you have entered it.

### My browser used to know my name -- why did it forget?

The browser will forget your name if you clear cookies for the site [whisper.clickonetwo.io](https://whisper.clickonetwo.io), and you will be asked for your name again the next time you join a conversation. 

### How do I change my name?

You can change your name in the home screen of the Whisper app, and you can change your name whenever you join a conversation in the browser.

### Does Whisper store the text of my conversations?

Not unless you have turned on transcription in your [Settings](instructions.md#settings). The contents of conversations held through Whisper are not stored anywhere, even on your local device. See our [Privacy statement](index.md/#privacy) for more information.

### Can I copy and paste text from my conversations?

The Whisperer can copy and paste what they have typed in the app, but Listeners cannot copy any text from the app or the browser.

### If I turn on *Read Aloud* while whispering, will it be on when I listen?

No. The state of all controls (Read Aloud, Font Size, and so on) is remembered separately for whisper and listen sessions.

### If I turn on *Read Aloud* while whispering in one conversation, will it be on when I whisper in another conversation?

Yes. The state of Whisperer controls is used for all conversations, and similarly for the state of the Listener controls.

## Need More Support?

If the answers above have not solved your problem, please contact us through [this form](https://forms.gle/qrzSnB46tFqMBUZq9) and we will get back to you as soon as we can. Please note that this is a single-developer app, so response times will not be immediate (or maybe not even quick).

At the [Whisper Project](http://whisper-project.org), we are firm believers that there are NO stupid questions, especially when it comes to using technology. We want to make Whisper as helpful as possible to everyone, so we truly appreciate your feedback.
