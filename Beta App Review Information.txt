This app is meant to be used by two or more people, one of whom is non-verbal (the Whisperer) and so types their "speech" into the app so it can be seen by the others (the Listeners).  Thus, you will want to use more than one device when reviewing.

This app does not support any kind of general "chat" functionality.  It facilitates spoken conversations between users who know each other in real life, where one of those users (the Whisperer) is non-verbal. Only Listeners who have been invited (and accepted their invite) to the conversation can see what the Whisperer is typing.  Listeners who join the conversation later on can never see what the Whisperer may have said before they join. A Listener can never copy or otherwise save what the Whisperer has "said" once the conversation ends. As with a conversation where all participants can speak, if a Whisperer ever said something offensive to a Listener, or vice versa, the offended participant could immediately tell the other, and could decide to leave the conversation (either temporarily or permanently).

By default, this app generates speech using Apple technologies.  Users who have an ElevenLabs account (available free to all users) can enter their ElevenLabs API information into the settings of this app in order to use ElevenLabs speech generation instead.  The app offers no additional functionality to users with an ElevenLabs account (whether free or paid).
